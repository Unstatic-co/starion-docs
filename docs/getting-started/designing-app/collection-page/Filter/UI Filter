You can build several conditions on one column at once that creates a Filter Group. A filter group is not neccessary to just contains the conditions on one columns only, it can have different conditions applied on different columns. We make it to work in all the way you want.
The conditions and filter groups will be activated following their order in the App Editor, from above to below (?).
